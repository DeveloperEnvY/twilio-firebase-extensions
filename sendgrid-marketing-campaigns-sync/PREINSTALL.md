Use this extension to add, update, or remove contacts from your [SendGrid Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/email-marketing/) contact list based on information added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.

Adding a document triggers this extension to add a contact to the Marketing Campaigns contact list. Updating a document will update the contact's data and deleting the document will trigger its removal from the contact list in SendGrid.

Here's an example document that would trigger this extension:

```js
admin.firestore().collection('contacts').add({
  email: 'someone@example.com',
  first_name: 'Bob',
  last_name: 'Bobson'
});
```

In the document you can add any of the following fields to your document and they will be applied to your contact:

| Field                   | type                |              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| `email`                 | string              | **required** |
| `alternate_emails`      | Array<string>       |              |
| `first_name`            | string              |              |
| `last_name`             | string              |              |
| `address_line_1`        | string              |              |
| `address_line_2`        | string              |              |
| `city`                  | string              |              |
| `postal_code`           | string              |              |
| `state_province_region` | string              |              |
| `country`               | string              |              |
| `phone_number`          | string              |              |
| `whatsapp`              | string              |              |
| `line`                  | string              |              |
| `facebook`              | string              |              |
| `unique_name`           | string              |              |
| `custom_fields`         | Map<string, string> |              |

`custom_fields` must be defined within your SendGrid account and are a map of the custom field's ID to the content.
