# Contributing to the Twilio Firebase Extensions

## About the project

This project is a collection of different Firebase Extensions within one repository. You can find each extension under the top level project directories.

## Before you contribute

We welcome everyone to contribute to this project. If you don't know what to work on, [check our open Issues](https://github.com/twilio-labs/twilio-firebase-extensions/issues) and specifically for the `Help Wanted` and `Good First Issue` labels.

If you want to work on one of those open issues, please comment on the issue to let us know that you are working on it. Similarly if you can't work on it anymore, please let us know.

If you are planning to contribute something that does not have an open issue yet, please open an issue for it before you start working on it. This way we can help you find a good solution.
